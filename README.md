DiceFeed is a dynamic social network where creativity meets competition. On DiceFeed, users can share diverse media—including videos, audio, images, and GIFs—accompanied by a unique title, in a single, ever-changing community feed. The platform features powerful filtering options by media type, a search bar that finds posts containing specific phrases or hashtags, and a direct messaging system for private conversations. Every month, the slate is wiped clean as all posts are deleted, but not before one outstanding post is crowned and enshrined on the exclusive "Wall of Fame," celebrating the best content for posterity.
