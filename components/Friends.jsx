/* Search Mechanism */
// Users will have an "Add Friends" button in the SideNavbar that takes them to a page where they can search for other users by name.
// The app should display the matching user, along with an "Add" button next to their name.

/* Add Friends Functionality */
// Users should be able to search for others by typing their name and send a friend request.
// If they are already friends, a message should notify the user that they are already connected.
// If they are not friends, the user can send a friend request.
// If a request has already been sent, a message should inform the user that the request is pending.
// If a request is pending, then a new request shouldn't be sent.
// The user should also be able to cancel a pending friend request.

  
/* Accept/Decline Friend Requests */
// When the user receives a friend request, they should have the option to either accept or decline it.
// The friend request should remain visible until the user accepts, declines, or the other party cancels the request.
